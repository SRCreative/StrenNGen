Password Strength checker and generation - Made Easy Peesy

StrenNGen is a JQuery plugin for Strength testing a password and Generating a password on a web form.

This plugin was created to fulfil a job requirement. It exists in version 1.0.1 as a "Get past the post" build, therefore it hasn't had time and care put into it at the moment. However, I intend to update as and when I can.
